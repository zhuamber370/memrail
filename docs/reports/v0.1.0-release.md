# Memrail v0.1.0

## Positioning

Memrail is a governed memory and task layer for OpenClaw workflows.
It is built for teams and individuals who want agent automation with human control.

## Problems addressed

1. Agent context drift across long sessions and tool switching
2. Noisy autonomous writes with weak approval gates
3. Missing rollback and source traceability for memory changes
4. Lack of a practical UI for humans to audit and correct agent outputs

## What v0.1.0 delivers

1. Governed writes
- Dry-run -> Commit/Reject -> Undo-last

2. Structured persistence
- Tasks (structured action records)
- Knowledge notes (classified, source-aware, linkable)
- Journals (append-only by day)

3. Human review UI
- Tasks Command Center (search/filter/list/detail + execution canvas)
- Knowledge page for classification and correction
- Changes page for proposal review and approval decisions

4. OpenClaw integration
- Workspace skill for high-level actions
- Unified REST entry path for read/write

5. Traceability
- Source references and audit event metadata in backend APIs

## Scope boundaries

- Self-hosted/local-first MVP
- No SaaS multi-tenant billing/OAuth yet
- Audit API is available; audit page is hidden from top navigation

## Validation snapshot

- `python3 -m pytest -q`
- `cd frontend && npm run build`

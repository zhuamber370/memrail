# Documentation Guide

This folder contains two doc types:

## 1) Current behavior docs (authoritative)
- `../README.md`
- `../backend/README.md`
- `../frontend/README.md`
- `reports/mvp-release-notes.md`
- `reports/mvp-e2e-checklist.md`

Use these when validating the current runtime version.

## 2) Historical snapshots
- `plans/*`
- dated records under `reports/*`

Historical files are preserved for context and decision trace.
If a historical statement conflicts with current code, follow the authoritative docs above.

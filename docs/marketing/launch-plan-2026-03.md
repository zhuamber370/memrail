# Memrail English-Market Launch Plan (2026-03)

Status: In Progress  
Owner: Marketing Operator (Codex)  
Approval Gate: Required before any public publish

## Goal

Get Memrail in front of the right English-speaking builders and convert attention into actionable feedback.

## Positioning to Hold Constant

Memrail is not "another note app."  
Memrail is a governance layer for agent writes in OpenClaw workflows.

## Channel Priority

1. Hacker News (`Show HN`)
2. Reddit (`r/selfhosted`, `r/opensource`)
3. X (founder/dev thread)
4. GitHub release/discussion announcement

## Two-Week Plan

### Week 1

- Finalize channel copy in `drafts/`
- Publish `Show HN` after approval
- Publish X thread within 24h of HN post
- Capture comments, objections, and repeated pain points

### Week 2

- Publish Reddit post to `r/selfhosted`
- Publish Reddit post to `r/opensource` (wording adapted)
- Publish GitHub announcement copy (release/discussion)
- Aggregate feedback into issue candidates or docs updates

## Success Criteria

- At least 3 external threads with real discussion (not just impressions)
- At least 10 comments/questions from likely ICP users
- At least 3 concrete product insights to feed roadmap/docs

# Marketing Operating System (English-First)

This folder is the execution hub for Memrail promotion.

## Mission

Generate qualified awareness and feedback from the English market for:
- OpenClaw users
- agent-heavy workflows
- teams that need governed writes (human approval + audit + undo)

## Operating Rules

- Public posts are drafted here first, then reviewed by project owner before publishing.
- Never claim metrics or customer outcomes without verifiable evidence.
- Keep messaging consistent with runtime truth in `README.md` and `docs/guides/agent-api-surface.md`.
- Do not add paid ads or spend budget without explicit approval.

## Core Message

Memrail is a PR-like governance layer for agent writes:
`dry-run -> diff preview -> human approve/reject -> commit -> audit (+ undo)`.

## ICP (Initial)

- Developers running OpenClaw in production-like workflows
- Builders who were hurt by uncontrolled agent writes
- Teams that require reviewability and rollback before memory/task writes

## 30-Day Targets

- 10+ meaningful conversations with relevant users
- 3+ high-signal product feedback threads/issues
- 1-2 external community posts that generate repeat discussion

Secondary metrics:
- GitHub stars, watchers, and fork growth
- README click-through to integration/docs pages

## Execution Loop

1. Research channel context and posting norms
2. Draft channel-specific copy in `docs/marketing/drafts/`
3. Submit draft to owner for approval
4. Publish approved draft
5. Log URL + outcomes in monthly launch plan
6. Iterate on angle, hook, and CTA

## File Map

- `launch-plan-2026-03.md`: current launch sprint
- `drafts/`: pending or approved public copy
